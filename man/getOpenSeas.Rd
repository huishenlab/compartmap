\title{Gather open sea CpG from a GRanges of CpG islands}
\usage{
getOpenSeas(gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{Input GRanges of CpG islands}
}
\value{
GRanges object that can be used with filterOpenSea()
}
\description{
This function accepts a GRanges input of CpG islands that can be derived
from UCSC table browser and rtracklayer::import(yourbed.bed). It resizes the
intevals to create 4kb flanking regions around CpG islands. Open sea
regions, as defined by \href{https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0741-y}{Fortin by and Hansen (Genome Biology, 2015)}, are outside this flanking
regions and obtained as their complement.

\examples{
#cpgi <- rtracklayer::import(system.file("inst/extdata/mm10_cpgi.bed", package = "compartmap"))
#opensea_cpg <- getOpenSeas(cpgi)
